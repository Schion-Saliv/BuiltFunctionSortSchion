# BuiltFunctionSortSchion

#This is a python program code I creatd to generates a random list of numbers which sorts the numbers from smallest to largest and should display the median

#I opted to implement a Built-in Function to obtain the minimum, maximum and median of a provided list.

#When the code is run, the outcome provides a selection of numbers unarranged and then they are organised from smallest to largest in which it will present the smallest digit and largest digit and calculate the median from the numbers provided.

#At the end, it should show the time taken in seconds for it to complete.
